			<h3>A Long Time Ago in A City Far, Far Away … …</h3>
				<p>
					Okay, okay, it wasn’t actually that long ago and it was in Detroit, Michigan. It was the spring of 2017. 
					I was working in a restaurant which, is my fall back skill set when I can’t find better work. 
					I’ve worked in a few different establishments over the past 16 years and I never made much money 
					but most importantly it never makes me happy. That spring I turned 30 and it was bothering me 
					where my life was going and how I hadn’t accomplished much in my 30 years in this world. 
					I became a little depressed and was trying to decide what I should do about this pitiful way I was feeling. 
					I had been looking for a better job with benefits and vacation time to no success, 
					living with family so I could afford to pay bills, and had two failed attempts at college under my belt.

				<h3>A New Hope</h3>
				<p>
					As I was saying, it was the spring 2017 and I was about to turn 30 when I made a new friend, Chris. 
					Chris worked as a front-end web developer in the building that my restaurant served lunch to everyday. 
					We chatted one day, became friends, and I invited him to my birthday party. A few weeks later, 
					we had dinner at a fantastic Mexican place and he was telling me about his job. I then told him 
					how I had dabbled over the years in web design and development myself. He then said, <em>“Why don’t 
					you learn more and do it?</em>” To which I replied, <em>“I don’t know.”</em> We continued to discuss it and by 
					the end of the conversation I had decided to go back to school for Web Programming. I made this decision 
					for two major reasons. One. Every time I had done some web page building I always enjoyed it, had fun doing it, 
					and it kept me interested. Two. Chris expressed to me the lack of women in the tech industry.
					That fall I enrolled in community college and started my new journey to becoming a Web Developer <a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Jedi">Jedi</a>.

					So, now it is 2018 and almost exactly a year later. I am going strong at school and well on my way 
					to what should be a new career that I will be proud of and happy about. Since I started last summer, 
					I have used all resources at my disposal to learn as much as I can. School being one of those resources, 
					the internet, and of course my friend and now mentor Chris. He helped me get started and helps me to learn 
					how the industry really works. He helped me change my life and pull myself out of depression. I’ve also 
					connected with the web development and tech community and met some wonderful people and some inspirational 
					women in the industry. I hope I can be as inspiring as they are to other young women thinking of going into 
					any kind tech field. I found something to learn and make a career out of and honestly, it saved me. 
					I was in a bad place in my life and now I have so many great things to look forward to.
